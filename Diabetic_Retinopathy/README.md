# Diabetic_Retinopathy

We all argue on whether Deep Learning will out perform Machine Learning if the data size is large.<br>
There is another argument/hypothesis which I've tried to test here i.e How well Deep Neural Network performs when data size is almost 1.5K<br>

As you can observe that the Data Set is a bit noisy so let's see in which model we can address the Overfitting Problem better<br>

######Data Set#########<br>
The Data Set contains almost 1.5K records of Diabetic Retinopathy case with different measurement values in .csv format<br>

There are 2 scripts<br>
1. dr_ml ====> This is the Machine Learning Script that gives almost 75% Accuracy<br>
2. dr_nn ====> The Deep Neural Net model that give almost 73% validation Accuracy<br>

Run both the script & find out for yourself.. weights & pre-trained models are included <br>
Change the model & tweak parameters as per your wish
